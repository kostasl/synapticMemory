 * This Function Generates a random +/-1 response using information from the last call.
 * It is used to generate the random stimuli induction train.
 *
 * dC is correlation //Prob[I2 = ±I1] = (1 ± C2)/2,
 * When using a correlation This function makes use of a static variable to remember the last induction step.
 *
 * This way it may generate driftless induction stimuli by Setting the correlation term to dC = -1 . so -1, 1,-1,1 sequences can be generated
 *	NOT MultiThread Safe - Uses static Variable
 * dC : Correlation term 0 gives random sequence, -1 gives  toggle of induction stimuli
 * Returns : 1 for a POT step -1 for DEP
 *
 * NOTE: If the function is inline then AllocationExperiment.cpp cannot find it!
